OPEN SOURCE TOOLS 
 DATA MANAGEMENT 
       RDBMS           : MySQL and PostgreSQL
       NoSql Databases : MongoDB, Apache CouchDB, and Apache Cassandra
       file-based tool Hadoop File System or Cloud File systems like Ceph	   
 ETL
     Apache Airflow
	 kubeflow - which allows the execution of data science pipelines on top of Kubernetes
	 Apache Kafka, which originated from LinkedIn.
	 Apache Nifi, which delivers a very nice visual editor.
	 Apache SparkSQL, lets you use ANSI SQL and scales up to compute clusters of thousands of nodes
	 NodeRED also brings a visual editor. 
	 In addition, NodeRED is so low in resource consumption that it even runs on tiny devices like a Raspberry Pi
	 
DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS
    PixieDust - pythion library also has user interface
	Hue       -- Create visualizations using SQL Queries
	Kibana    - a data exploration, and visualization web application is limited to Elasticsearch (data provider). 
	Apache Superset is a data exploration and visualization web application.
MODEL DEPLOYMENT TOOLS are 
    Apache PredictionIO, Seldon, Kubernetes, Redhat OpenShift, Mleap, TensorFlow service, TensorFlow lite, and TensorFlow dot JS.
MODEL MONITORING TOOLS are 
    ModelDB, Prometheus, IBM AI Fairness 360, IBM Adversarial Robustness 360 Toolbox, and IBM AI Explainability 360. 
	
CODE ASSET MANAGEMENT tools are Git, GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket.  
DATA ASSET MANAGEMENT tools are Apache Atlas, ODPi Egeria, and Kylo.

Developemnt Environments :  Jupyter Notebook 
                            Jupyter LAb -- Nxt version of Jupyter Notebook
							Apache Zepplin - similiar to jupyter Lab
							R studio
							Spyder
							Apache Spark - batch processing
							Apache flink - image processing
					        Ray - with more deep learning models
						    KNIME  - drag and drop facilities
							Orange
