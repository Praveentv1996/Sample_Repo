Scientific computing libraries
     used for data cleaning
     Pandas -- Work with 2d dataframes
	 NumPy -- with Arrays and matrices.
	 
Data Visualization lib
	MatPlot1lib -- for graphs , plots
	SeaBorn -- Timeseries , heatmaps , violin plots
	
Machine learning lib
    ScikitLearn - statistical model --> regression, classification & Clustering
	              It is Built on scipy, numpy and matplotlib
	Keras  - Allows to build deep learning model simply [high level], GPU is needed

Deep learning lib
    TensorFlow - Low level framework, for production and deployment of Large scale Deep Learning models
	PyTorch    - reasearchers use this to test ideas
	
Apache spark - use more than one computing clusters to process data in parallel 
               similiar to numpy, pandas and scikit learn
			   Apache spark Data processing jobs are available in R, Python and scala , SQL
			   
Other Lang Libraries 
    scala - vegas - data viz
	        BigDL - for Deep learning
	R - ggplot2 - data viz
	
API :  other API, Rest API
Data Asset Exchange (DAX)
Model Asset Exchange (MAX)  - use of Pretrained models takes less time to train Deep learning model
