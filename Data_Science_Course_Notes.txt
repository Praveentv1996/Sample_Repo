data mining : summary

       1. cost - benefit trade off
	   2. Level of accuracy from result
	   3. Right selection of data has impact towards cost of data mining exercise
	   4. PreProcessing a raw data to deal with missing & Erroneous data.
	   5. Transforming data into proper format , reducing the attributes using PCA and dimensionality 
	      reduction to get relevant attributes.
	   6. Storage of data and its security.
	   7. Data is subjected to data mining after all the above tasks.
	   8. Starting pt of data mining is data visualisation to understand trends hidden in the dataset.
	   9. First step in data mining is data visualization.
	  10. Data mining and evaluating the results becomes an iterative process such that the analysts use better 
	      and improved algorithms to improve the quality of results generated in light of the feedback received 
		  from the key stakeholders.
	  11. In-sample forecast is the process of formally evaluating the predictive capabilities of the models developed 
	      using observed data to see how effective the algorithms are in reproducing data.
		  
Neural Networks : Notes

1. Computers trying to mimic real neurons of human brain.
2. Deep learning ---> more layers of neural networks.
3. Use case --> Speech Recognition.

Application of Machine learning ---> Mainly, Recommendation System
